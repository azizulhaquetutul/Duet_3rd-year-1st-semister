\subsection{Benefits for Students and Teachers}
This methodology helped identify how AI could assist both students and teachers in educational settings. For students, the findings showed that AI could personalize learning, adapt to individual learning paces, and provide immediate feedback, making learning more accessible and tailored to individual needs. Students who face difficulties in specific areas could use AI to get extra support and improve their skills.

For Teachers AI reduced the time spent on repetitive tasks, like grading papers or tracking attendance, allowing teachers to focus on teaching and mentoring students. AI-generated reports gave teachers a clear view of student performance, helping them design better lessons and address individual challenges. By understanding these benefits, educators could better integrate AI tools into their classrooms to improve the overall educational process

\section{Results}
The first paper by Chen et al. (2020) showed that AI had been successfully used to automate administrative tasks in schools and universities. Tasks like grading assignments and tracking student performance were made more efficient, which allowed teachers to spend more time on teaching \cite{r1}

AI also made education more accessible by providing real-time feedback and allowing students to learn at their own pace. For students with disabilities or those who could not attend regular classes, AI created opportunities to learn through virtual classrooms and adaptive technologies \cite{r10}

AI in education enables personalized learning, adjusting to each student’s unique
needs, strengths, and interests. It uses machine learning to analyze students’ behavior,
preferences, and achievements, tailoring their learning experience. For example, AI can
recommend resources, suggest improvements, and adjust task difficulty. The key benefits include supporting struggling students and challenging advanced ones. Personalized
learning boosts engagement, motivation, and academic performance, leading to better retention

\end{figure}

AI tools offered students personalized learning experiences by tailoring lessons to their individual needs. For example, intelligent tutoring systems helped students improve their understanding of complex subjects by providing targeted support. Tools like ChatGPT assisted with brainstorming and writing, especially for non-native English speakers \cite{r3} \cite{r9}

Selwyn (2022) highlighted the challenges of using AI in education, especially around issues of data privacy and algorithmic bias. This paper stressed the importance of ethical considerations when implementing AI in classrooms to avoid unfair treatment of students \cite{r4}


\section{Discussion}
The results showed that AI had the potential to greatly improve the educational experience for students by offering personalized learning and efficient administrative support. For example, AI systems could quickly grade tests and provide feedback, which saved teachers time and helped students learn more effectively. However, the discussion also raised concerns about the ethical use of AI, especially regarding the privacy of student data and the fairness of AI decisions.

One of the key discussions was about the balance between AI and human teachers. The findings from Chan and Tsi (2023) made it clear that while . Teachers brought unique qualities like empathy and the ability to inspire students, which AI could not replicate. This suggested that the best approach was to use AI as a tool to support teachers rather than as a substitute.

Another key point was that AI should complement, not replace, teachers. While AI could handle repetitive tasks and provide personalized lessons, it could not build relationships, motivate students, or teach soft skills. Teachers remained essential for guiding students and creating a supportive learning environment


AI can also analyze past performance, identify weaknesses, and adapt the pace of instruction, ensuring a more effective learning experience.

\section{challenge }

One of the biggest challenges in using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education was protecting student data. AI systems collected large amounts of personal information, which raised concerns about how this data was stored and used. Misuse of this information could lead to breaches of privacy \cite{r3} \cite{r8}

Over-reliance on AI tools might discourage students and teachers from developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills. There was also a risk that some students, especially in underprivileged areas, might not have access to the technology needed to use AI systems \cite{r10}

The review revealed several challenges in integrating AI into education, primarily data privacy and security. AI systems need vast student data, posing risks of misuse. Selwyn (2022) stressed the need for robust data protection to keep student information secure \cite{r4}

Ethical considerations were also highlighted, with Chan and Tsi (2023) emphasizing that while AI could assist teachers, it should not replace them, as human interaction is essential for critical thinking and emotional development in students \cite{r10}

\section{Future Work}

Future research should focus on creating ethical AI systems that prioritize data privacy and security. Clear policies and regulations are needed to ensure AI tools handle sensitive student information responsibly \cite{r8} Efforts should be made to reduce biases in AI algorithms and improve their accuracy. This could be achieved by using more diverse datasets and involving educators in the development process to make sure AI tools address real-world needs \cite{r3} \cite{r6} 

AI should be designed to work alongside teachers rather than replace them. Future work could explore ways to enhance collaboration between AI tools and human educators, allowing teachers to focus on building relationships and fostering creativity in the classroom\cite{r6} \cite{r10} 

Additionally, there is a need for continuous professional development for educators. Teachers should be trained to effectively use AI tools in their teaching practices, which will require ongoing support and learning opportunities. This will ensure that educators are equipped to maximize the benefits of AI while mitigating any challenges.

Finally, addressing policy and ethical frameworks will be crucial for the future of AI in education. Governments and educational institutions should work together to develop guidelines that ensure the ethical use of AI, protecting students' rights and promoting fairness across educational systems

\section{conclusion}
The review of the selected papers showed that Artificial Intelligence (AI) had a significant impact on education by enhancing personalized learning and reducing teachers' administrative workload.
However, it also highlighted several challenges, including data privacy concerns, potential biases in AI algorithms, and ethical considerations. The findings emphasized that while AI could greatly assist in educational processes, it could not replace the human elements that teachers bring, such as empathy, creativity, and critical thinking.

Despite these challenges, AI showed great promise in enhancing education when used as a supportive tool alongside human expertise. Future research and innovation could focus on improving fairness, expanding accessibility, and understanding the long-term impacts of AI in education.Future efforts needed to focus on addressing these challenges and ensuring that AI was used as a supportive tool to improve the overall educational experience.
